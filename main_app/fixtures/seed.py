Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof To kick the truth to the young black youth But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer And ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted That what? That life is hectic",

Feelin' mad hostile, ran the apostle Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel Stroll with the holy roll, then attack the globe with the buckus style The ruckus, ten times ten men committin' mad sin Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums, we'll be Comin' around the mountain when I come Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment My clan increase like black unemployment Yeah, another one dare, G-Gka-Genius Take us the fuck outta here",
