#From the Slums of J-SON#

##Headline##

From the Slums of JSON is a real REST API that anyone can use for prototyping or testing. Rather than some gibberish pseudo-Latin, it features the words and wisdom of the Wu-Tang Clan.

FSJ is a Python/Django/PostgreSQL that uses a hybrid of Django Rest Framework and some custom architecture to create a learning and testing resource for people building out REST projects. Unlike other services, FSJ users are indeed updating a real database and getting correct responses, which allows for more efficient cursory testing and even automated testing.

The homepage also serves in reverse as a Postman-like interface to test a user's own REST API.
